## Preface
I'm Peppa Pig.

This is my little brother, George.

This is Mummy Pig.

And this is Daddy Pig.

(V.O.: Voice Over 旁白)

## Pancakes!
It is tea time.

V.O.: And Mummy Pig has a surprise for everyone.

Mummy Pig: Today is a day for pancakes!

Daddy Pig: Pancakes! Delicious!

Peppa Pig: I love pancakes!

V.O.: Everyone loves pancakes!

Daddy Pig: I'm the expert at flipping the pancakes over! Leave that to me!

Peppa Pig: Are you sure, Daddy Pig? Last time you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor.

Daddy Pig: I did not get grumpy. There was a problem with the frying pan.

Peppa Pig: Mummy. Can we help make the pancakes, please?
